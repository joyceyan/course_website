##Assignments
Homework will be assigned roughly once per week. It will be graded, and require substantial work. The average student should expect to spend about 15 hours per homework. Homeworks will typically contain a mix of programming exercises and "theory" questions about data structures and their implementation. Roughly every other homework will contain a piece that contributes toward the class project, which is to build a simpler version of Google Search from scratch. As the project progresses, students may find it necessary to revisit and improve their earlier solutions, so good coding practices and documentation are strongly encouraged.


Each student will receive a private code repository on the course's [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/usc-csci104-fall2015) to use it for the development and submission of all assignments. You will be using the [git](http://git-scm.com/) source code management tool to maintain your homework code.

#### Grace Days (Late Submissions)
Each student has 4 grace days they can use over the course of the semester. **You may only use 1 grace day per assignment**. Once you have used your grace days, any late submission will not be accepted and graded as a 0.

To use a late day you <strong>MUST follow</strong> the submission policy outlined in our [submission instructions]({{ site.url }}/submission-instructions.html) to alert the course staff to fetch your late submission.  Failure to follow these instruction and fill out the late-submission form will result in 0 credit for the assignment. 

Note:  **There is NO grace period.** Even if you submit a few minutes after the deadline, you will need to use a late day (even if the wireless network in your dorm room is down or you have a github issue, etc.). It is your job to be on time and not cut it too close.  Leave time for things to "go wrong".

### Submission Instructions
In order to properly submit your assignment, please follow the course [submission instructions]({{ site.url }}/submission-instructions.html)

###Rubric
Be sure to read our [grading rubric]({{ site.url }}/grading.html) for deductions that we will take on any program (things like memory leaks, poor coding style, etc.


### Academic Integrity
The official language on academic integrity is on the [**syllabus**]({{ site.url }}/syllabus.html) . Here is a little more clarification.

Practically speaking, it is important to be able to seek out helpful information and collaborate, yet it is clearly wrong to pass off work done (even just in part) by others as your own. When in doubt whether some behavior you are considering is appropriate, feel free to consult with us (course staff) before engaging in it. As a general guideline, imagine that your professor is looking over your shoulder, but can't read your mind. Would it look to him like you're legitimately seeking to understand things, or trying to get a better grade than your own work warrants? That should guide your behavior.

A few things are clearly fine, while a few are clearly not fine. We are listing some of the most relevant ones here:

- Asking other students for hints or discussing high-level ideas. This is clearly OK.
- Having other students look at your code and help you discover mistakes. This is also OK, though the other student may have to be careful about not copying - from you (which would have negative consequences for both of you).
- Asking course staff (instructor, TAs, sherpas) for help, ideas, having them look through code, etc. Clearly no problem; if you are asking for too much help, we'll simply not provide that much.
- Copying code from other students, even if you subsequently edit, improve or change it. Clearly not OK, even if you intend to understand the code before submitting it as your own. This is most definitely plagiarism. We will run software on all submissions in the class to detect instances of copying.
- Sharing your code with your classmates. Even if you have the best of intentions, such as helping a friend understand the material, this is very dicey. It allows someone to appear to do better than they do. We have had several cases of trusting friends getting into trouble because their "friends" submitted code as their own.
- Looking at other students' code (before having finished your own). This is a gray zone. If you just take away some basic conceptual ideas, then it is fine. If your code ends up resembling the other student's very closely, then it is cheating. To avoid accidentally cheating, we recommend that whenever you checked out a friend's code extensively, you spend significant time (about an hour) doing something else before returning to your own code. That way, you will just work based on your understanding of the code, and not accidentally copy anything.
- Looking up concepts, syntax, and basic instructions on how to deal with the topics online. This is clearly OK, as you are learning.
- Looking online for solutions to specific homework questions, such as copying code from Wikipedia and other sites. Clearly not ok, even if you subsequently edit them. You are trying to use the work of others instead of your own. Clearly cheating.
- Posting in online forums asking people to solve homework questions (or parts thereof) for you. Clearly cheating, for the same reason as the previous one.
- Unfortunately, we are aware that (1) there are solutions to many homework questions available on the WWW, and (2) even USC students tend to cheat quite frequently on homeworks. Please help us restore faith in the integrity of Trojans by not being those students.
